        Current >>> 111.11Hpd >> Our speed to reach 1000 hours, compared to our
        last record of "111.11 hours per day", has decreased by 0.00 hours per
        day. Maybe in this journey towards 1000, we can try harder to increase
        our speed and reach our goal.

        reach 1000 hours, compared to our last record of "4.63 hours per hour",
        has decreased by -0.00 hours per hour. Maybe in this journey towards
        1000, we can try harder to increase our speed and reach our goal.
